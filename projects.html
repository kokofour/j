                <p>A mobile app game called <em>Adventure Quest</em> that I built using HTML,CSS and Javascript in collaboration with a friend.
                    I first worked on this project during highschool and later debugged it for errors before releasing it to the public.
                    This game can be downloaded on the Google Play or IOS Store!</p>
