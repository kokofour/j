        <h2>Who am I exactly?</h2>
        <img src="avatar.png" alt="Avatar" class="avatar">
        <p>Born and raised in New York City, I am a second-generation Asian American with a multicultural perspective on life. 
            I graduated from the University at Buffalo with a bachelor’s degree in Management Information Systems, 
            but beyond my academic and professional background, I am an introvert at heart (INFP personality type) 
            who enjoys deep conversations and meaningful connections. I speak both English and Chinese, and I’ve been exploring Korean as well.
            My interests span from technology and digital creativity to personal growth and cultural exploration. 
            In my free time, I enjoy learning new skills, reflecting on life’s complexities, and finding ways to balance my introverted nature</p>

            All of these are important hobbies for me and some of them took quite a long time to learn!
